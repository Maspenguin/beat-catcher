This is a simple beatcatching game that uses wav files to seed the level.
To play the game select a song from the menu.
The mouse can then be used to control the paddle. 
Use the paddle to block as many asteroids from reaching the bottom of the screen as possible.

Music files must be 16bit wav
Music can be swapped out with another wav file given the file name song1.wav, song2.wav or song3.wav
